# SKY_SCRAPE
A multi-purpose social network analysis program built around the powerful Twitter scraper Snscrape.

Literally anyone can use this Twitter scraper. It does not require Twitter API authentication or even a Twitter account. The only requirements are Python and an internet connection.

My technical goal for this project was to master the art of interrogating ChatGPT until it spat out relatively scalable, 
easy-to-use code for information operations analysis. I am new to programming so this project is far from perfect, I welcome any and all feedback.
